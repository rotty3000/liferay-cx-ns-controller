## A Controller that manages Client Extension Namespaces from DXP Virtual Instance ConfigMaps

When the Liferay DXP Kubernetes Agent is enabled, for every Virtual Instance defined in DXP, it emits and maintains a ConfigMap that describe the Virtual Instance. When Virtual Instances are created a new ConfigMap is added. When a Virtual Instance is deleted the ConfigMap is removed and when the Virtual Instance is updated the ConfigMap is updated.

The controller should ensure the existence of at least one Namespace for each Virtual Instance. The namespace name should be autogenerated to reflect the Virtual Instance's id combined with an application alias (which by default is `cx`). This alias allows multiple Namespaces to be associated with the Virtual Instance. This allows for Marketplace Apps to be isolated into their own Namespace while still being associated to the Virtual Instance.
